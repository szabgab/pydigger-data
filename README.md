* Create the pydigger-data-new repository
* Copy the `README.md` file and the `.github` folder from the `pydigger-data` repository to the new one.
* `git init`
* `git add .`
* `git commit` in the new repository.
* Create the repository on GitHub.
* Map and push out the new repository.
* Enable GitHub pages on the new repository.
* Run the job manually so we'll have the first set of data.

* On GitHub in the old repository remove the URL from GitHub pages and add it to the new repository.
* rename the old `pydigger-data` to `pydigger-data-N`
* rename the new `pydigger-data-new` to `pydigger-data` so I won't have to update the links.
* Locally also rename the folders and update the `remote` mapping in the `.git/config` file in both.
