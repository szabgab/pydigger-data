By contrast,\n        our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\n        share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n        software for all its users.\n        \n        ...\n        \n        [Full license text continues]\n        \n        ...\n        \n        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n        \n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n        \n        If you develop a new program, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software that everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n        \n        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\n        attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state\n        the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n        \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n        \n            copyright 2025 Dennis A.
