The prevailing party \n        in any litigation is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs from the other party.\n        \n        \n        OTHER TERMS.\n        \n        Entire Agreement and Changes. This agreement constitutes the entire \n        agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous \n        negotiations or agreements, whether oral or written, related to this subject matter. \n        User is not relying on any representation concerning this subject matter, oral or \n        written, not included in this agreement. No representation, promise, or inducement \n        not included in this agreement is binding. No modification or waiver of any term of \n        this agreement is effective unless both parties sign it.\n        \n        No Assignment. Neither party may assign or transfer this agreement to a third \n        party, nor delegate any duty, except that the agreement may be assigned, without \n        the consent of the other party, (i) as part of a merger or sale of all or substantially \n        all a party's businesses or assets, of User, and (ii) in the case of AMV at any time \n        to any third party.\n        \n        Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors with respect \n        to each other, and neither party is an agent, employee, or partner of the other \n        party or the other party's affiliates.\n        \n        Enforceability and Force Majeure. If any term of this agreement is invalid or \n        unenforceable, the other terms remain in effect. Neither party is liable for its non-\n        performance due to events beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited \n        to natural weather events and disasters, labor disruptions, and disruptions in the \n        supply of utilities.\n        \n        Money Damages Insufficient. Any breach by a party of this agreement or \n        violation of the other party’s intellectual property rights could cause irreparable \n        injury or harm to the other party. The other party may seek a court order to stop \n        any breach or avoid any future breach of this agreement.\n        \n        Survival of Terms. All provisions of this agreement regarding payment, \n        confidentiality, indemnification, limitations of liability, proprietary rights and such \n        other provisions that by fair implication require performance beyond the term of \n        this agreement must survive expiration or termination of this agreement until fully \n        performed or otherwise are inapplicable. The UN Convention on Contracts for the \n        International Sale of Goods does not apply.\n        \n        Compliance Audit. No more than once in any 12-month period and upon at least \n        30 days’ advance notice, AMV (or its representative) may audit User’s usage of the \n        Software at any User facility. User will cooperate with such audit. User agrees to pay \n        within 30 days of written notification any fees applicable to User’s use of the \n        Software in excess of the license.\n        \n        Export Compliance. The Software and Confidential Information may be subject to \n        export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Each party \n        represents that it is not named on any U.S. government denied-party list. Neither \n        party will permit its personnel or representatives to access any Software in a U.S.-\n        embargoed country or in violation of any applicable export law or regulation.\n        \n        U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If User is a United States government \n        agency or acquired the license to the Software hereunder pursuant to a \n        government contract or with government funds, then as defined in FAR §2.101, \n        DFAR §252.227-7014(a)(1), and DFAR §252.227-7014(a)(5), or otherwise, all \n        Software provided in connection with this agreement are “commercial items,” \n        “commercial computer software,” or “commercial computer software \n        documentation.” Consistent with DFAR §227.7202 and FAR §12.212, any use, \n        modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, disclosure, or \n        distribution by or for the United States government is governed solely by the \n        terms of this agreement and is prohibited except to the extent permitted by the \n        terms of this agreement.\n        \n        Open Source Software Licenses. The Software may contain embedded open source \n        software components, which are provided as part of the Software and for \n        which additional terms may be included in the technical documentation.\n        \n        Feedback. If User provides feedback or suggestions about the Software, then AMV \n        (and those it allows to use its technology) may use such information without \n        obligation to User.\n        ",
