However, you may\n        only distribute the software according to [Distribution\n        License](#distribution-license) and make changes or new works\n        based on the software according to [Changes and New Works\n        License](#changes-and-new-works-license).\n        \n        ## Distribution License\n        \n        The licensor grants you an additional copyright license\n        to distribute copies of the software.  Your license\n        to distribute covers distributing the software with\n        changes and new works permitted by [Changes and New Works\n        License](#changes-and-new-works-license).\n        \n        ## Notices\n        \n        You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of\n        the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the\n        URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines\n        beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided\n        with the software.  For example:\n        \n        > Required Notice: Copyright Tyler Burch (https://github.com/tjburch/linear-term)\n        \n        ## Changes and New Works License\n        \n        The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to\n        make changes and new works based on the software for any\n        permitted purpose.\n        \n        ## Patent License\n        \n        The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that\n        covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able\n        to license, that you would infringe by using the software.\n        \n        ## Noncommercial Purposes\n        \n        Any noncommercial purpose is a permitted purpose.\n        \n        ## Personal Uses\n        \n        Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for\n        the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private\n        entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious\n        observance, without any anticipated commercial application,\n        is use for a permitted purpose.\n        \n        ## Noncommercial Organizations\n        \n        Use by any charitable organization, educational institution,\n        public research organization, public safety or health\n        organization, environmental protection organization,\n        or government institution is use for a permitted purpose\n        regardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting\n        from the funding.\n        \n        ## Fair Use\n        \n        You may have \"fair use\" rights for the software under the\n        law. These terms do not limit them.\n        \n        ## No Other Rights\n        \n        These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of\n        your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from\n        granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply\n        any other licenses.\n        \n        ## Patent Defense\n        \n        If you make any written claim that the software infringes or\n        contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license\n        for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If\n        your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends\n        immediately for work on behalf of your company.\n        \n        ## Violations\n        \n        The first time you are notified in writing that you have\n        violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software\n        not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless\n        continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,\n        and take practical steps to correct past violations, within\n        32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses\n        end immediately.\n        \n        ## No Liability\n        \n        ***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without\n        any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable\n        to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use\n        or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***\n        \n        ## Definitions\n        \n        The **licensor** is the individual or entity offering these\n        terms, and the **software** is the software the licensor makes\n        available under these terms.\n        \n        **You** refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these\n        terms.\n        \n        **Your company** is any legal entity, sole proprietorship,\n        or other kind of organization that you work for, plus all\n        organizations that have control over, are under the control of,\n        or are under common control with that organization.  **Control**\n        means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity,\n        or the power to direct its management and policies by vote,\n        contract, or otherwise.
